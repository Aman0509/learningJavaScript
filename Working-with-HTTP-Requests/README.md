## [What & Why](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=18MZto3hCXlh6x1PZIgKVotxtfF23MSWh)

This module focuses on network requests, but what precisely do they entail and why do they matter?

- Building web pages involves a combination of HTML code for structure and script logic.
- JavaScript isn't essential for basic functionality; server-side languages like PHP can handle dynamic content generation.
- However, JavaScript can enhance user experience by enabling interaction without page reloads.
- JavaScript can validate user input, manage interactions like post deletion, and facilitate asynchronous communication with the server.
- By preventing default actions, JavaScript can intercept form submissions, validate data, and send HTTP requests to the server.
- Backend typically involves an API, exposing endpoints for various operations like fetching and storing data.
- Direct communication between the browser and server, resulting in full-page reloads, is not ideal for user experience.
- Instead, JavaScript communicates with specific endpoints on the server, allowing targeted interactions without page reloads.

Therefore, understanding APIs and HTTP requests (GET, POST) is crucial for effective use of client-side JavaScript.
